### 문제 설명

<p>You are walking by a row of K (4 ≤ K ≤ 25) lights, some of which are on and some of which are off. In this initial configuration, there is no consecutive sequence of four lights that are on.</p>

<p>Whenever four or more consecutive lights are on, the lights in that consecutive block will turn off.</p>

<p>You can only turn on lights that are off.</p>

<p>What is the minimum number of lights you need to turn on in order to end up with all K lights off?</p>

### 입력 

 <p>The first line of input will consist of the integer K, indicating the number of lights. Each of the next K lines will have either the integer 0 (to represent a light that is off) or the integer 1 (to represent a light that is on).</p>

### 출력 

 <p>Your program should output the minimum number of lights that must be turned on in order to have all K lights be off.</p>
